Data types

- Datas shall be immutable
- Data shall be not nullable (shall be checked at constructor or adding) for IdSet or OrganizerItems

- I will start only with local DB to get started (having the the mind also remote for the future) for Task, Tasks, Note, Topics, Tag, Reminder, User

For now, you can use just the DAOs in the TaskDataSource to handle linking between Task and Tag, User, and Reminderï¿½this keeps the architecture simpler while the relationships are straightforward.
If any relationship becomes complex, you can always split off a dedicated data source (like TaskTagLinkDataSource) later, following the Single Responsibility Principle.

In UI we should not operate with nullable data, it should be empty list or default value

DTO is the item with all the links DTO<Entity>
