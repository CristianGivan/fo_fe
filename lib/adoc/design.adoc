== Naming Convention

* UpdateLinkItemsOfItemUseCase; UpdateLinkItemsOfItemBlocEvent; _onUpdateLinkItemsOfItem
** "Of" conveys ownership or association. Since you’re dealing with a set of links that already
belong to the item (with the potential to modify, add, or remove elements in that set), this naming captures the complete scope of the operation more effectively.

* Dto suffix for data transfer objects
** I used more generic because other terms like link or view may confuse with other elements in
the future

== External Libraries

* don't use external libraries unless you have to, keep the dependencies to a minimum
** don't use Freezed  Equitable is enough for the moment

== Domain

=== Use Case

* linking

=== Empty

* use isEmpty as a state not at a method
* use singleton to define a empty object

== Data

=== Local data source

* Start with db.transaction if you’re still building out the core functionality. Once your app starts scaling and performance becomes a concern, optimize with customSelect. This keeps your implementation flexible and adaptable to future needs.

=== Repository

* in the repository I don't modify the data, I just converted from and to local  datasource and get it and send it to the use case

*

== Presentation

=== Stateless and Stateful Widgets

* I should strive to use stateless widgets as much as possible

=== Screen

*I will not use the Dynamic Layout + Factory + Delegation pattern for now because the trade off
is not worth it
* everything that is display o a screen with the scope of serving one thing like display all task
or add new task

=== Page

* is a section of the screen that is dedicated to a specific task like a list of tasks or a form to

=== Widget

* every other thing that is displayed on the screen like a button or a text

== Reminder

=== New link between items

* don't forget to delete also this link in local data source
