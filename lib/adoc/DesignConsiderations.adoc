==== Empty

* use isEmpty as a state not at a method
* use singleton to define a empty object

==== GetAllItems

* this is refacing to the log in user because I don't want to add "ForLogInUser" in all this
cases. I see from user point of view
* for other cases hat to be explicitly mentioned

== Local data source

* Start with db.transaction if youâ€™re still building out the core functionality. Once your app starts scaling and performance becomes a concern, optimize with customSelect. This keeps your implementation flexible and adaptable to future needs.
