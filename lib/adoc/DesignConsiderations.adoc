== External Libraries

* don't use external libraries unless you have to, keep the dependencies to a minimum
** don't use Freezed  Equitable is enough for the moment

== Domain

=== Empty

* use isEmpty as a state not at a method
* use singleton to define a empty object

== Data

=== Local data source

* Start with db.transaction if youâ€™re still building out the core functionality. Once your app starts scaling and performance becomes a concern, optimize with customSelect. This keeps your implementation flexible and adaptable to future needs.
