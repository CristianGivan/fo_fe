== Toughs

* if I want to sync a task and I separate the sync of the task with the sync of other tasks that are downloaded with that task that had to be update afterwords
** can I combine sync with async data?

* the error handler and update the local cash shall be don in lower level methods

List<TaskEntity> sau TaskEntities as a list

=== User

A user shall have a name, email, password,created date.
A User can have a user list, when a user want to pick a to be added to a task reminder or other then shall be chose from this list. If it is not in the list it can be added

=== Auth

auth must have:
id, userId, token, deviceInfo, createdDate, expiredDate, lastUsedDate, isActive

events:
logIn, logOut, getLogInUser, switchUser, refreshToken, autoLogIn

states:
authenticated, unauthenticated, uninitialized, runGuest, authenticating, authFailed

to have the keep me log in checkbox at log in if is set then the user can be log in automatically after the application is restarted

to have a page where there can be 2 tabs logIn/switchUser and register

Token Encryption

Handle multiple sessions gracefully, especially if the same user can log in from multiple devices.
if for device is there are more users that are loged in

 get the device user for all platforms in flutter

don't generate code I would like only to understand:
the encription and decryption shall be done in datasource or repository?
if I have so much logic in repository what logic shall I have on usecase?
what do you think is the difference between deviceUser and deviceInfo? should I concatenate all the info in one field?
this refreshToken will be called by user or automathicaly ? if is authomaticaly then why I have expiration date?
getActiveAuthForDevice or better getActiveAuthForUserDevice? or better deviceInfo and deviceUserr

usecase
auto_log_in
get_log_in_user_id
log_in
log_out
refresh_token
sign_up
switch_user
