all started long time ago when I want to be a a better person, why I need it to be a better
person is another story, I started to read and then listen to books and then podcasts an after
few years I ralize that I know a lot of things but when I want to find the things that I know I
couldn't remember them or I coudn't find them so I started to write them down and then I tried a
lot of things starting with excel end ending with dedicated note taking.
all were ok until a point when it wasent everioane knows that the life of one person is
complicated and if you are a cutios person nowaday you can getter a lot of information in a short
period of time so colecting and finding all you need can be to much for the tools that I used so
I decided to create one first I thougt that it will be a simple app but after I discussed with
some fiends that know programing and even they agree to spend some howers with me to create a
draft thei realize how complicated it will be so that is the reason than we didnt discused about
that topic anymore:D. But timpe passed and I lost forgat a lot of things so I decided to start a
new aveture creating this app. and for this I wanted to start with something but with what ? So I
decided to start from 0  even if I had some thenical beckgroud programing wasent something I did
seriossly  but I sed how hard it could be to lear programing :D. So I started with an workshop
and then with an few mouths of course and then I decided to change my carier. And in my time left
I started to work at this app.
