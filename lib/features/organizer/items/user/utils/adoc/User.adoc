=== UserType

Local: Users whose accounts are created and used only on the current device. They don’t sync with any remote server.

Remote: Users who exist on a server and are accessible across multiple devices. They don’t have a full profile locally but can interact with local users.

Temporary: Users created offline with minimal information. They have restricted access and can be converted to a synced user upon connection to the internet.

Synced (or Hybrid): Local users who are also registered on the server, allowing them to sync data and access their account from other devices.
